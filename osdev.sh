# Creates an locally built, editable INCLUDEOS_PACKAGE that can be passed
# to any integration test for a rapid OS development.
# The script can be called from anywhere and will create two directories:
# - build_includeos  : the local build you can rebuild with make -j install
# - includeos_package: the install target you can build a unikernel against.
#
# PS: I've tried to make all of this happen inside the nix shell for unikernels,
# but failed. If someone has a neat trick to make nix do all of this in one shell
# that might be even better.
